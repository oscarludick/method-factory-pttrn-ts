# Method Factory Pattern

The following text was obtained from the book [Head First Desing Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Eric-Freeman/dp/0596007124).

Instantiation is an activity that shouldnÂ´t alaways be done in public and can be often lead to coupling problems.

If your code is written to an interface, then it will work with any new classes implementing that interface through polymorphism. However, when you make use of lots of concrete classes, you are looking for trouble because that code may have to be changed as new concrete classes are added. Your code will not be "closed to modification". To extend it with new concrete types, you will have to reopen it.

We take what varies and encapsulate it to create new objects, this is called a Factory. Factories handles the details of object creation.

### The Simple Factory

The simple factory is not actually a desing pattern, it's more of a programming idiom. But is commonly used.

Example simple factory: 

```ts
export class CharacterCreationFactory {
  createCharacter(classType: string): Character {
    if (classType.equals("knight")) {
      return new KnightCharacter();
    }
  }
}

export class CharacterCreator {
  private _characterFactory: CharacterCreationFactory;
  constructor(characterFactory: CharacterCreationFactory) {
    this._characterFactory = characterFactory;
  }

  customizeCharacter(classType: string) {
    const character: Character = this._characterFactory.createCharacter(classType);
    //do stuff...
  } 
}
```
